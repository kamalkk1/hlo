Overview


This project consists of two tasks: Task 1 and Task 2. Each task focuses on creating a responsive web page using HTML5 and CSS3. 
The goal is to implement the tasks while following best practices in front-end development and considering accessibility.

Task 1: Requirements Completed
For Task 1, I have successfully met the following requirements:

Utilized HTML5 and CSS3 for creating the web page.
Ensured responsiveness across various devices and screen sizes.
Followed industry best practices in front-end development.


Task 2: JavaScript Filtering Feature


The main objective of this task is to enhance user experience by providing the ability to filter a list of items from the provided data using various criteria. Users will be able to seamlessly interact with the filtering options, and the page will respond efficiently to their selections.

Implementation
To achieve this,i  followed these steps:

Displayed the list of items from the data.js, utilizing HTML to structure the content appropriately.

Created filter options, such as category and availability, using HTML elements. These options will serve as user inputs for filtering.

Implement JavaScript code to handle user interactions and filtering. The JavaScript code will dynamically update the displayed items based on the selected criteria.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
